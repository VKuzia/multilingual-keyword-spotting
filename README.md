# Multilingual keyword spotting
This repo contains my coursework project based on the [following paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01454).

Its purpose is to check whether using multilingual embeddings in KWS models increases KWS quality over monolingual embeddings.
Deep learning and few-shot technique using transfer learning principle are involved.

I haven't got any significant results so far, so this page will be edited as soon as I get them.
